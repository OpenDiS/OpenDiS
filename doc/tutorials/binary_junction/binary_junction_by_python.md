### Binary Junction by Pure Python

This example shows a binary junction formation simulation. Binary junctions are formed when two different dislocations overlap each other. The code can be simply run by PyDis in pure Python mode where no compilation is needed.

Two dislocation lines becomes into three dislocation lines.
This is part of the energy minimization process.
Two dislocation is merged when they are in contact --> junction.

```bash
cd ~/Codes/OpenDiS.git/examples/03_binary_junction
python3 -i test_binary_junction.py
```

Initial node positions is assigned to variable ```rn``` as
```
rn    = np.array([[0.0, -z0, -z0,  DisNode.Constraints.PINNED_NODE],
                      [0.0,  0.0, 0.0, DisNode.Constraints.UNCONSTRAINED],
                      [0.0,  z0,  z0,  DisNode.Constraints.PINNED_NODE],
                      [-z0,  0.0,-z0,  DisNode.Constraints.PINNED_NODE],
                      [0.0,  0.0, 0.0, DisNode.Constraints.UNCONSTRAINED],
                      [ z0,  0.0, z0,  DisNode.Constraints.PINNED_NODE]])
```


**Boundary condition**




<mark>To do: describe this simulation.  Initial condition.  Boundary condition.  Behavior of the dislocation.</mark>
<mark>Done: describe this simulation.  Initial condition.  Boundary condition.  Behavior of the dislocation.</mark>



The code will produce animation of binary junction formation process. The following two figures shows the result of the simulation.

The first figure shows the initial configuration of the simulation.
