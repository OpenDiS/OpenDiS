### Binary Junction by Pure Python

This example shows a binary junction formation simulation. The code can be run by

```bash
Run OpenDiS in pure python mode (PyDiS) -- no compilation needed
cd ~/Codes/OpenDiS.git/examples/03_binary_junction
python3 -i test_binary_junction.py
```

the code will produce animation of binary junction formation process.
