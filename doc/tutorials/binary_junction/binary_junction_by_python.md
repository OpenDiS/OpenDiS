### Binary Junction by Pure Python

This example shows a binary junction formation simulation. Binary junctions are formed when shear stresses are applied to a slip plane whereas other slip plane is free of stresses. The code can be simply run by PyDis in pure Python mode where no compilation is needed.

```bash
cd ~/Codes/OpenDiS.git/examples/03_binary_junction
python3 -i test_binary_junction.py
```

The code will produce animation of binary junction formation process. The following two figures shows the result of the simulation.

The first figure shows the initial configuration of the simulation.
