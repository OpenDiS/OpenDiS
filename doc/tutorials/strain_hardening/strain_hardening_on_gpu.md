### Strain Hardening Simulation on GPU
To run strain hardening simulation on GPU, execute the same commands as those written in [Sec. 3.3.1](https://caiwei-stanford.github.io/opendis-doc/tutorials/strain_hardening/strain_hardening_on_cpu.html) in the corresponding example directory. The outputs are also the same as those calculated on CPU.
