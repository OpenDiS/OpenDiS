We envision a layered architecture, where a set of Core Libraries, such as ```PyDiS``` and ```ExaDiS``` provide the fundamental functions and classes for setting up and performing dislocation dynamics simulations.
OpenDiS provides a framework where higher level utlities and helper classes can be constructed to facilitate innovative research.
The OpenDiS framework also provides an opportunity for standardizing specifications, thereby enhancing data analysis efficiency.

See [OpenDiS Manifesto](../manifesto.rst) for more details on the goals of the OpenDiS project.
