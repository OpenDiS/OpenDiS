Welcome to OpenDiS!
===================================
.. admonition:: :large:`Revolutionizing Dislocation Dynamics Simulations Through Open Source Collaboration`
    :class: important

    :large:`The OpenDiS Project is a community-driven initiative aimed at developing a robust open-source code framework and a code development platform for dislocation dynamics (DD) simulations. Our mission is to provide a high-performance, accessible, configurable, and extensible tool enabling researchers to explore the intricate world of dislocation lines and their impact on materials behavior.`

    :large:`We invite you to join the OpenDiS project to shape the future of dislocation dynamics. Together, we can build an open-source code and develop an open collaboration platform for accelerating scientific innovation.`
